    <div class="testWidth bold italic">Who am I and why should you choose to work with me?</i></b></div>
    <div class="testWidth"><p>In 2009 I routinely ate a family size package of Cadbury Mini Eggs (you know, the crunchy ones, not the Crème ones) for dinner.  Or to switch it up I’d eat a Reese’s Peanut Butter Bar – not just the 2 cups – it was a full size family size bar.  A can of apple pie filling with a graham cracker or two was often breakfast.  A can of fat free Reddi-whip was always waiting for me in the fridge.  Not surprisingly I was carrying a little extra weight but I was athletic and under my winter hiking gear the extra natural insulation I was carrying wasn’t really obvious.  But I felt terrible.  I counted the minutes until it was “dinner” time (AKA mini egg time).  If I didn’t eat my lunch on time I was HANGRY.  And my 6 LITER a day Coke Zero habit was even mocked by my 8th grade students.  My skin wasn’t much better than when I was 13 and my athletic training never made me look like an athlete.  I learned about Paleo eating at CrossFit and dabbled in it a little.  But I still drank Coke Zero by the 2 liter bottle and ate chocolate (but it was 85% dark!) every night after dinner.  Oh, and I still logged all my food on an on-line food tracking app.  I stumbled on the W30 on line and decided to try it. </p>
    </div>  
    <div class="testWidth"><p>I never really thought I’d make it.  I mean, 30 days with no chocolate?  No way.  And no Coke Zero?  I’d die.  For sure.  I knew it.  Or if I didn’t, I certainly wasn’t going to make it 30 days.  But… I did.  I went 30 days with no chocolate and no Coke Zero.  I haven’t had a diet soda in over 10 years.  I drank my last bottle the night before I started my first Whole30.  And chocolate after dinner.  Meh, I can take it or leave it.  But when I do have it, it certainly isn’t a family size bar!  We eat mostly W30 in our home most of the time.  My 2 year old cries when they aren’t sampling cauliflower at Trader Joe’s.  My skin no longer looks like I’m in high school.  And sometimes I eat breakfast and then don’t eat until 4 PM again because I just forget to eat.  I can snowshoe 10 miles in the Adirondacks after eating just a few hardboiled eggs – and I’m not lugging Gatorade and Skittles with me to make it through the day.  I’ve completed Spartan Races and half marathons and continued to gain strength in the gym.  I am truly a different person now because of the Whole30 and I’d never go back to the way I used to eat.  And I want to help you have the same kind of life changing experience.
