<span class="blueText">What is the Whole30?<br/></span>
<span class="testWidth">
Certain food groups (like sugar, grains, dairy and legumes) could be having a negative impact on your health and fitness without you even realizing it. Are your energy levels inconsistent or non-existent? Do you have aches and pains that can’t be explained by over-use or injury? Are you having a hard time losing weight no matter how hard you try? Do you have some sort of condition, like skin issues, digestive ailments, seasonal allergies, or chronic pain, that medication hasn’t helped? These symptoms are often directly related to the foods you eat—even the “healthy” stuff.

    <div class="text-center">
            <span class="redText">So how do you know if (and how) these foods are affecting you?<br/></span>
              <div class="testWidth">        
            <span class="blueText">Strip them from your diet completely. </span>
            <span>
                    Eliminate the most common craving-inducing, blood sugar disrupting, gut-damaging, inflammatory food groups for a full 30 days. Let your body heal and recover from whatever effects those foods may be causing. Push the reset button with your health, habits, and relationship with food, and the downstream physical and psychological effects of the food choices you’ve been making. Learn how the foods you’ve been eating are actually affecting your day-to-day life, long term health, body composition, and feelings around food. The most important reason to try this?

<div class="text-center testWidth">As a Whole30 Certified Coach I will coach you through the 30 days of the Whole30 and show you how to shop for and prepare delicious foods made from meat, poultry, fish, fruits, vegetables, healthy fats and tubers.  After the 30 days I will then guide you through a systematic 10-day period of food reintroduction so you can find out exactly how the foods you have eliminated effect you (and then you decide if you want to make these foods a regular part of your life again).   Think of me as your best friend who has already done a Whole30 and loved it and now wants to spend 30 days helping you!  We are going to go to the grocery store together, we are going to come up with a meal plan together, we are going to meal prep together and of course I’m available for questions or a gentle push whenever you need one.   </div>
<div class="text-center">These are just a few of the things I hope to help you with during our time together:
    <ul>
        <li>Develop new habits regarding nutrition that you will have for the rest of your life</li>
        <li>Refine techniques for bulk cooking to help make eating nutrient dense foods an every day part of your life</li>
        <li>Become aware of how the quality of your food affects the way you feel, think, exercise and sleep</li>
        <li>Become aware of how your food choices can lead to feelings of addiction and cravings and that you do NOT have to eat these foods            </li>
