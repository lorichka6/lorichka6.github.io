<div class="bold">Coaching Options</div>
<div>I currently offer 2 different coaching options</div>
  <div class="container-fluid">
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-xs-6">
<span class="bold">Option 1: Your best friend for the next 40 days.  </span>
<span><p>This is the best option if you are feeling overwhelmed by starting a Whole30, if the Whole30 is a drastic change in your eating patterns or if completing the 30 days is non-negotiable.  As your coach we are going to spend some substantial time together.  We are going to meal plan, grocery shop and cook together.  Does clearing out your pantry scare you?  I’ll be there with you.  New to bulk cooking?  No worries, we’ll do it together.  Not sure how to use your Instant Pot/Immersion Blender/Air fryer – I’ve got it covered (and you can try any of my gadgets before deciding to but your own!).  This option will include about 10-15 hours of 1 on 1 time as well as any internet/phone support you feel you need.   You will have my support for the entire of your 30 days on the Whole30 and the ~10 days of your reintroduction.</p></span>
<span>Cost: $250    </span>

          <div class="col-xs-6">
                <span class="bold">Option 2: Your accountability buddy for the next 40 days.</span>
                <span><p>This is the best option if you are pretty sure you’re good.  Maybe you’ve been gluten free or dairy free for a while so you are pretty confident reading labels and being careful with your food choices or maybe you’ve tried a Whole30 before and it turned into a Whole20 or Whole5 or WholeBreakfast… and you just want someone to help you make it the Whole30 days.  This option includes daily email support.  I’ll be there to help you when you need some recipe ideas, some bulk cooking suggestions or some help deciding that it is worth it to just.put.down.that.cookie.  I’m available via phone, text and email for this option but there is no 1 on 1 time.</p></span>
